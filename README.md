# Stopwatch
Very simple and small stopwatch. Runs always on top. Made with Python and tkinter.

## Run it
$ python3 route/to/main.py

### Linux
Needs to have tkinter library available. tkinter is part of standard libray but tk-dev system package 
needs to be available when compiling Python from source.

If using system Python, need to install python-tk package.

Only tested on Linux, probably works on other platforms too with minor changes.

## Functions
Reset: Double-click on label (Can not be running)

Show seconds: Right click on label

Add or substract 5 minutes: Mouse wheel on label
